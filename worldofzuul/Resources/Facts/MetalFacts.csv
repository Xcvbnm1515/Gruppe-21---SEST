Every year, around 400 million tons of metal are recycled worldwide.
Scrap metals are refashioned for use in creating bikes, cars, aircraft and other modes of transportation.
Metal recycling helps recreate a new product once the original items have reached the end of its useful life.
There is no limit to the amount of times aluminum cans be recycled.
Recycling aluminum uses 90 percent less energy than making primary-production aluminum!
It can take as little as 60 days for an aluminum can to be recycled and returned to the supermarket shelf as another can of soda!
Precious metals found in electronics are recyclable, too.
Americans throw away more than $700 million worth of aluminum cans every year.
In a landfill, aluminum and tin cans will stick around for decades.
An aluminium can that is thrown away will still be a can 500 years from now.
